# New Todo App

A simple and efficient Todo application built with React and Vite. This project aims to provide a minimal setup for creating a React application with fast development experience and optimized production build.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
- You have a basic understanding of JavaScript, React, and Vite.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhijeetroyyy/new-todo.git
cd new-todo
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

To build the project for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory.
